# TODOs

- Implement one of the genetic algorithms seen in class
- Improve benchmarking framework (currently just the tsp_analysis.ipynb)
    - Improve performance comparison charts
    - Add optimal solution verification for problems that have it
- Set up a python script to take the tsp and output the tsp solution 
    - with maybe optional command line arguments for algorithm selection
- Create the PDF report
